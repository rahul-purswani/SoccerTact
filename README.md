<br>SoccerTact is an advanced web application designed to provide comprehensive soccer analysis. It offers detailed match-based analysis, including match statistics and timelines, as well as team-based analysis such as passing networks and team dominance heat maps. Additionally, it features player-based analysis, showcasing shot maps and individual player dominance heat maps. The application utilizes event data from StatsBomb's open data repository. We built a robust data pipeline to automatically extract data from the StatsBomb GitHub repository and store it in an MySQL database.

<b>What I Learned:</b>
- Full-Stack Development: I gained experience in building a full-stack web application, integrating both frontend and backend technologies.
- Data Pipeline Creation: I learned how to design and implement an automated data pipeline, enhancing my skills in data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: I developed my ability to analyze and visualize complex datasets, presenting meaningful insights through interactive visualizations.
- Collaboration and Version Control: Working with GitHub and managing version control was crucial in collaborating with team members and maintaining the project's codebase.
